# ReflectanceCNN

## Overview

ReflectanceCNN is a deep learning project designed to predict optical properties (e.g., refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) from reflectance spectra using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization tools. It is particularly useful for applications in material science, optics, and photonics.

## Features

CNN Model: A 1D CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers and fully connected layers for regression tasks.

Data Preprocessing: Tools for loading, normalizing, and splitting reflectance data.

Training and Evaluation: Includes training loops, early stopping, and metrics calculation (e.g., RÂ², MSE, RMSE).

Optimization: Post-training optimization to refine predictions.

Visualization: Plotting tools for visualizing training results, predictions, and optimization outcomes.
